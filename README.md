Hi,
I have officially started learning C++, my main aim is to master the language and this could lead me to entering Quant Dev.
I have previously made many efforts/plans that i could get into IB's as QuantDev but due to my lack of efforts and no hunger I always end up nowhere.
No I have a perfect opportunity where I am working at IBM and using JAVA as primary languange which will definitly help me staying focused.
I promise myself to atleast dedicate 15 hours a week to this goal.
